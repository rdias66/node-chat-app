# node-chat-app
App built for practice and study purposes.

It consists of a chat built with socket io.

The messages are saved simultaneously in the db using Prisma.
Currently it saves each message individually at real time, but for performance issues it will be changed. Probably for packs of messages sent from time to time.

Front end in a differente rep. ( node-chat-app-frontend )
